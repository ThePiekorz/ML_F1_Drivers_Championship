# F1 World Champion Reggression.
Machine learning model that predicts F1 World Champion.

# Dataset
In this project I used dataset available on kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cjgdev/formula-1-race-data-19502017

# Model
It's a neural network, with optimized hyperparameters using RandomSearch.

# Results
Usage of Earltstop did not help to improve results.
Overall accuracy around 2.8 places in not that bad.
KerasTuner gave simmilar results to first NN Model, but with a bigger NN Model.


# Improvments
Few things that could improve the score:
  - Usage of Classification rather than regression would be a better option,
  - Usage of differnt data_sets like, informartion about racetracks.
